## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

basically i learnt how to easily use flexbox and how to include the necessary flexbox properties,also i learnt a new idea of using the <b> tag before <p> tag easily and how to put a circle in a box.

```html
<b>92</b>
<P> /100 </p> 
```
```css
.card-container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
.result {
    width: 50%;
    padding:1.5rem 2rem;
    border-radius: 2rem;
    background: hsl(252, 58%, 47%);
    text-align: center;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 1rem;
}
